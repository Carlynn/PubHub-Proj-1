Our app is called Pub Hub

PURPOSE:
To help the community of San Francisco locate their nearest Privately Owned Public Outdoor Space. This app will assist each individual by allowing them to see a San Francisco map and determine where their nearest Pub Hub is located. In addition to this, we are also allowing the community to write reviews on these outdoor spaces.
